    <h2 class="headersize">What is your long term goal or career pathway?  </h2>
    <p>
      My goal for my career is to get in to a position where I am constantly being challenged allowing myself to <br>
      constantly improve myself both technically as a developer and also as a employee/co-worker. Also somewhere <br>
      that allows for growth/progression as I improve. <br> 
    </p>
      
    <h3 class="headersize">  A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning </h3><br>
      <p>
      I think my key strength would be adaptability, both to new technologies and also just to any new circumstances <br>
      that may change the way I have to work or learn.<br>
      If I had to pinpoint one weakness I would likely say for me at this stage it could still be time management<br>
      as if I am having trouble with an element or piece of work I'm not very good at taking a step back from it<br>
      when I get frustrated once I have run out of solutions to try. This can result in me taking more time to complete<br>
      something than I otherwise would have.<br>
    </p>

    <h4 class="headersize"> What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4> <br>
      <p>
      I would like to improve my communication as I believe that especially compared to my previous work experience Developer<br> 
      type work benefits a lot from effective communication from all parties involved that are collaborating on a project.<br>
      Another skill which I have also been big on trying to capture in my learning and develop is growth mindset as I think<br>
      it is hugely beneficial both for my learning during this course and also for when I have to try and transition these<br>
      skills to a work environment.<br>
    </p>
      
     <h5 class="headersize"> How will I manage my workload during this program?</h5><br>
     <p>
      I think the biggest thing for me is to make sure I start off the week well allowing me to progress through at a reasonable pace which allows<br>
      me to have extra time if I get stuck or require more time to learn and pick up certain things, rather than trying to spread the work out through<br>
      until sunday afternoon and then getting stuck on something leading me to miss deadlines.<br>
      </p>
      
      <h6 class="headersize">What you I do if things are building up and starting to get to me?</h6><br>
     <p> 
      If I am starting to feel frustrated or annoyed with a problem I will go and take a 10 minute break go outside grab some fresh air and some water<br>
      and then try to re-visit the problem with a refreshed mind. If I have an ongoing problem I will communicate with the facilitators or if there are<br>
      other learners that I am collaborating with to solve the problem rather than letting it go on to become an even bigger problem.<br>
      I will seek help via the available channels in the discord server (tech-questions, help requests) or from messaging and talking to people who may<br>
      have faced the same problem or seen a solution to it from other people facing similar issues.<br>
      </p>
      <h7 class="headersize">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h7>
      <p>
      I hope that most of the time during the week they can be available to talk to and help students that need it when we stumble and so far in my experience they <br>
      have been and have been a great help so far.
      </p>
      
      <h8 class="headersize">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. </h8>
     <p>
      For me sometimes I help my Grandma out with things as I am usually the most flexibile schedule wise to help her out. This isnt always terribly often and can be sporadic timing<br>
      wise but usually it is just for an hour or two. However since she is coming off of major surgery these may be more frequent over the next few weeks. However I don't see this <br>
      baring any negative impact on my ability to learn or keep up with the course content.<br>
