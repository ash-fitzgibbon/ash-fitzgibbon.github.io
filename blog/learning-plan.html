    <h2 class= "headersize" >What is your long term goal or career pathway?  </h2>
      <p>
      My goal for my career is to get in to a position where I am constantly being challenged allowing myself to <br>
      constantly improve myself both technically as a developer and also as a employee/co-worker. Also somewhere <br>
      that allows for growth/progression as I improve. <br> 
      </p>
      
    <h3 class= "headersize" >  A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning </h3><br>
      <p>
      I think my key strength would be adaptability, both to new technologies and also just to any new circumstances <br>
      that may change the way I have to work or learn.<br>
      If I had to pinpoint one weakness I would likely say for me at this stage it could still be time management<br>
      as if I am having trouble with an element or piece of work I'm not very good at taking a step back from it<br>
      when I get frustrated once I have run out of solutions to try. This can result in me taking more time to complete<br>
      something than I otherwise would have.<br>
     </p>

    <h4 class= "headersize" > What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4> <br>
      <p>
      I would like to improve my communication as I believe that especially compared to my previous work experience Developer<br> 
      type work benefits a lot from effective communication from all parties involved that are collaborating on a project.<br>
      Another skill which I have also been big on trying to capture in my learning and develop is growth mindset as I think<br>
      it is hugely beneficial both for my learning during this course and also for when I have to try and transition these<br>
      skills to a work environment.<br>
      </p>
      
    <h5 class= "headersize" > How will I manage my workload during this program?</h5><br>
      <p>
      I think the biggest thing for me is to make sure I start off the week well allowing me to progress through at a reasonable pace which allows<br>
      me to have extra time if I get stuck or require more time to learn and pick up certain things, rather than trying to spread the work out through<br>
      until sunday afternoon and then getting stuck on something leading me to miss deadlines.<br>
      </p>
      
    <h6 class= "headersize" >What you I do if things are building up and starting to get to me?</h6><br>
      <p> 
      If I am starting to feel frustrated or annoyed with a problem I will go and take a 10 minute break go outside grab some fresh air and some water<br>
      and then try to re-visit the problem with a refreshed mind. If I have an ongoing problem I will communicate with the facilitators or if there are<br>
      other learners that I am collaborating with to solve the problem rather than letting it go on to become an even bigger problem.<br>
      I will seek help via the available channels in the discord server (tech-questions, help requests) or from messaging and talking to people who may<br>
      have faced the same problem or seen a solution to it from other people facing similar issues.<br>
      </p>
      
    <h7 class= "headersize" >A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h7>
      <p>
      I hope that most of the time during the week they can be available to talk to and help students that need it when we stumble and so far in my experience they <br>
      have been and have been a great help so far.
      </p>
      
    <h8 class= "headersize" >Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. </h8>
      <p>
      For me sometimes I help my Grandma out with things as I am usually the most flexibile schedule wise to help her out. This isnt always terribly often and can be sporadic timing<br>
      wise but usually it is just for an hour or two. However since she is coming off of major surgery these may be more frequent over the next few weeks. However I don't see this <br>
      baring any negative impact on my ability to learn or keep up with the course content.<br>
      </p>

    <h9 class= "headersize" >What is my long term goal/career pathway</h9>
      <p>
      Long term I'd like to have developed my skills and got enough experience here to land a programming job in Japan. This is because I have friends that are working english speaking <br>
      programming jobs in Japan. And I've stayed in Japan before so I know it's a place I'd love to visit and further my career in , in the future. In the short term after leaving Dev Academy <br>
      I'd like to try and aim for a job in Wellington or Auckland as from what I've seen the job opportunities are better up there. I'd hope that whatever role I land is one where I can make an <br>
      immediate positive impact on my work environment but also continue to develop my skills both as a programmer and as a colleague/employee.
       </p>

    <h10 class = "headersize" >What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h10>
      <p>
      I'd say my strength may be perserverance and ability to try and solve problems I face step by step. I've found problem solving to feel extremely rewarding especially in JS . I would say that <br>
      so far for me JavaScript is the language that I had enjoyed the most and also the language that I understand the best so far.<br><br>
      A weakness for me I feel may be the depth at which I've learnt some of the foundations concepts. Especially for me my CSS is not very good however I am aiming to try and shure up my CSS skills <br>
      in the week before bootcamp starts to hopefully either reduce this weakness or develop it in to a strength.
      </p>

    <h11 class = "headersize" > What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at bootcamp will be? </h11>
      <p>
      I think that for me time management might be one of the biggest challenges I face especially in the first couple weeks of the bootcamp as I adjust my schedule and workload expectations <br>
      compared to what I have experienced and got used to during foundations. However I'd imagine this only really being a concern for the first 1-2 weeks.
      </p>

    <h12 class = "headersize" > What non-technical skills would you liked to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? </h12>
      <p>
      I think that I would like to improve upon all of them but if I had to pick one to really try and improve on I would say communication as especially after the course when we move in to the <br>
      workplace its important that I communicate effectively as a part of a team to make sure that if I face any issues I can resolve them in a timely matter in order to avoid holding the rest of <br>
      the more experienced co-workers up. Also teamwork within groups as I obviously do not have a huge amount of experience coding in a group yet.
      </p>

    <h13 class = "headersize" > What are my expecations from the bootcamp team?</h13>
      <p>
      I'd say that based off of the experience in bootcamp I'd expect them to be a fairly available resource for us to contact and use as a sort of sounding board for issues we face in the challenges <br>
      and then for people who get really stuck and escalate their problems to the #help-requests discord channel hopefully they're able to set aside some time to jump in a call with that person and work <br>
      through whatever the problem is they're facing. But that seems to be a fairly consistently available thing based of what I've seen in foundations.
      </p>

      <h14 class = "headersize"> What are your expectations of yourself within the bootcamp? </h14>
      <p>
        I want to be able to make the most effective use of both my time and the available resources to make sure that I can learn in the most effective way possible for the duration of the bootcamp as there <br>
        is a huge amount of information to take in during the bootcamp. I think I will try to reach out for help sooner when I get stuck rather than spending hours on a problem I'm stuck on as I do not think <br>
        there will be enough time for me to spend hours stuck on problems that may have obvious solutions that I'm not seeing that either a facilitator or other student may see at a glance. I'll try to make <br>
        sure that I am able to meet the expecations that both myself and other people may set on me within a group setting.
