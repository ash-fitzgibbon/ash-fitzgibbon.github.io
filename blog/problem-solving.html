            <h2 class="headersize">When was I blocked on a simple problem?</h2>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>What was the problem? <br> I couldn't stop throwing error codes because of a syntax error I could not find.<br></li>
                    <li>What problem solving techniques did I use? <br>At first I just kept trying different things as I thought there must be a mistake.<br></li>
                    <li>How did you feel throughout the process <br>Frustrated due to feeling like the code I had written was correct.<br></li>
                    <li>What did I learn?<br> Try to start by checking potential obvious fixes through errorcodes or console logging to find where the issue is and then go from there.<br></li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

            <h3 class="headersize">When was a time I elegantly solved a problem</h2>
                <p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>What was the problem? <br>My code was a bit of an unreadable mess at the start due to not formatting it nicely.<br></li>
                    <li>What problem solving techniques did I use? <br>Orginally I just ignored it as I thought oh well only I will see this code for now.<br>Then after sharing a liveview code session with a fellow student I noticed the difference in our formatting and he quickly showed me how to improve mine.</li>
                    <li>How did you feel throughout the process <br>I felt quite embarrassed to start as I thought of it as something everyone should just know.<br></li>
                    <li>What did I learn?<br> I'm not expected to know everything yet and its okay to ask other students for help as they are also taking this journey and to me so far have been very understanding and kind.<br></li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                <h4 class="headersize">Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h2>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                        <li>Pseudocode <br> I am still not entirely used to writing Pseudocode yet however I am getting better at it and found it very useful during the last 2 Katas. <br></li>
                        <li>Trying something <br> This is something that I usually resort to first as my first instinct is always oh well I haven't got it correct yet. However this shouldn't always be my go to response. <br></li>
                        <li>Rubber ducky method <br> I have not really used this yet however since reading good things about it maybe it is something I should try to incorporate to my problem solving. <br></li>
                        <li>Reading error messages <br> Generally speaking I am pretty comfortable with these and they have been a great help for time saving and locating where the mistake might be faster. <br></li>
                        <li>Console.logging <br> Usually not my first response however this is something I am coming to use more and more especially having seen Joseph use it quite commonly in his demo videos to check things. <br></li>
                        <li>Googling <br> Being a few weeks in to the course I have really found websites and resources that I know I can rely on to quickly access correcy and helpful information. <br></li>
                        <li>Asking my peers for help <br> I have been fortunate to get to speak to a couple of other Christchurch students who have been very kind and very helpful towards me when I have gotten stuck. Especially in previous weeks they helped alot.<br></li>
                        <li>Asking coaches for help <br> Often I feel like my issue isn't "pressing enough" or worth the coaches time which I think is the incorrect mindset and I really should be less afraid to ask for help when I've gotten stuck. <br></li>
                        <li>Improving your process with reflection <br> The past 2 weeks or so I have tried to make a lot of effort towards given detailed relfections as I think that reflecting on the week in detail better allows me to see where I could have done better during the week.<br></li>
                       </ol>
