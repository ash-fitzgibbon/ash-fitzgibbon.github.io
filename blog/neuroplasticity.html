            <p>
            Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.
            Understanding how our brain is malleable better lets people understand their ability to change their habit and to learn new things.
            It can make people realize that ability to or take in new information isn't nessecarily something you have to be born with , It is
            a skill that we can improve and develop upon over time. Anybody can use neuroplasticity for their personal benefit to improve 
            the way they think.
            </p><br>


           <h3 class="header"> Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h3>
           
           <p>
           For me personally its beneficial as in the past when I have had to deal with adversity and difficulty in learning new things
            I have often gotten very down on myself but reminding myself how I learn can remind me that something being difficult isn't
            a reason to get upset or frustrated at myself.
            </p><br>
            
            
            <h4 class="header">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h4>
            
            <p>
            All of the resources repeat similar things that neuroplasticity is developed when cells are used in the same way repetitively
            they build stronger connections. Eventually they become solid paths that our brain has developed over time making it easier for
            our brain to access these pathways. Basically repitition is key as it helps develop these hard-wired connections and practice makes permenant.
            This is why we were told that its better even on days where we may not be able to do as much course content atleast jump on and try to do
            15 minutes as this repition helps build up a habit and our knowledge.

            <h6 class="header">Research Growth Mindset</h6>
            <h7 class="headersize">Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h7><br>
            <p>
            Growth mindset is how we think when learning new things especially when faced with challenges. It is when people approach learning with
            a mindset of even if they have difficulty now its not because of innate "talent" or anything like that its just because there skill isn't
            there YET. It tells us that with work and effort we can improve at things over time. It is relevant to EDA due to the fact that save for
            a few of us that have CS degree backgrounds coming in to the course , for most people this is a course that is full of new information
            and skills we did not have prior to joining.

           <h8 class="headersize">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? </h8> <br>
            <p>
              Not really as growth mindset was something I was already aware of and had discussed with my brother at length.
            </p><br>
            
            <h9 class="headersize">Change for you?</h9><br>
           <p>I will say that seeing things like this is a reminder in how to approach my learning and remember the benefits of growth mindset.</p> <br>
            
            <h10 class="headersize">How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h10><br>
           <p> I will use it to help me problem solve when faced with difficulty as like I said a large percentage of what we are learning and
            doing week to week is completely new for me.

            <h11 class="headersize">Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h11><br>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.mindsethealth.com/matter/growth-vs-fixed-mindset">Growth vs Fixed mindset</a> This was good for me as it not only shows the benefits of a growth mindset
            but also how approaching things with a fixed mindset can be a detriment to learning at times.

            <h13 class="headersize">Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h13><br>
            <p>
              I think that maybe each day before I start my course content for the day I will integrate practicing mindfulness beforehand as a lot of
              the resources I looked through showed there is a link between mindfulness and growth mindset and ability to learn. During this time I
              will also try to remind myself that frustration is okay and somewhat expected even but it is how I deal with it that matters. And I 
              need to be better at asking for help in #Tech-questions or wherever else sooner rather than stewing on a problem for a couple of hours
              and becoming really annoyed at myself.
