            <h2 class="header">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
              <p>
                <ol>
                <li>How harmful it can be to solely compare myself to other people within the course. Due to this all being new information and also not knowing what kind of background other people may have in coding.</li>
                <li>That I've found it difficult to ask for help on some things due to me thinking "that should be obvious" and having a mindset of I shouldn't need help with some things. I think that has slowed me down at times.</li>
                <li>Reflection has been a great boon for me for being able to better see and feel progress week to week and really to see what I've learn that I didn't know before.</li>
                </ol>

            <h3 class="header">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
              <p>
                To me the value of empathy in programming is the ability to empathize with people in a group/collaborative setting even when things may not be going smoothly <br>
                as being able to understand how your colleagues are feeling about the work better allows you to be more productive in that co-working space to get the tasks done.<br>
                Self awareness is extremely valuable as you need to be able to understand how your actions and your contributions to whatever you are working on are impacting those <br> <br>
                around you whether it is due to not acting in a way thats beneficial to yourself or others, Or if you are coding in a way that would make it difficult for others to interpret or work on. <br>
                Values are the things that collectively make up who we are as a person and the impact we put out on to the world so having a strong/good set of values allows you to push <br>
                through difficult times and also how to be the best version of yourself when things are going well too.

            <h4 class="header">What has surprised you the most about core learning?</h4>
                <p>
                How a decent part of what we've learnt are things that I already tried to practice prior to the course but the lessons on core learning have helped me improve <br>
                and refine those processes to better make use of them. Especially within the context of coding and adversity/challenges that we are likely to face within the course. <br>
                I've also come to enjoy it a lot more than I perhaps initially thought I would have.
                </p>

              <h5 class="header">Why do you think EDA a programming school spend so much time focusing on core learning in a web development course?</h5>
                <p>
                It was explained to us fairly well that EDA as a program are always asking employers and people in the industry what they want or look for in new employees <br>
                We were told that they value people who have well developed core/people skills and that can often be a difference maker in who they hire. To me I think this <br>
                makes a lot of sense as from a programming perspective whilst the course is building up our knowledge at a pretty rapid pace to try and prepare us for the workforce <br>
                the reality is even after the course is completed there is still going to be a massive amount of room for improvement and new learnings that will happen once we are <br>
                hired in to a web development job. So from an employers perspective they would rather have someone who has adequate programming knowledge for the position but also <br>
                displays good core skills like the ability to be productive in a co-working environment as well as someone who is a good learner through some of the things we have <br>
                practiced like growth mindset.

            <h6 class="header"> Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? would the time have been better used just doing more programming?</h6>
                <p>
                I honestly don't believe this to be the case as I personally have experienced as I got further in to the course and faced some challenges that I couldn't initially solve <br>
                that the learnings I've taken from the core learning component of the course have allowed me to better deal with and manage frustration and then also better work towards <br>
                problem solving whatever the problem I initially had was. I also think that there is a limited amount of programming time that is beneficial towards learning in a day <br>
                I've found that when I've had a good 6 hours of programming and trying to learn whatever the concepts were that day I've understood them better and more completely than <br>
                days where I've tried to push beyond that and do a lot more in a day. I get the work done but then following that I don't think i've learnt the knowledge from it to the <br>
                same level. Which is why I say that spending the time I spent on core just on more programming wouldn't have been beneficial to me.
