            <h2 class="header">What is emotional intelligence?</h2>
            <p>
              Emotional intelligence refers to a persons ability to understand, control and evaluate emotions. It is often considered to <br>
              be a skill that can be learned and strengthened.The ability to express and control your own emotions is critical but that <br>
              alone doesn't correlate to a high emotional intelligence. You have to be able to understand,interpret and develop emotional <br>
              responses to the people around you.

            <h3 class="header">How is it different to iq?</h3>
              <p>
                Put simply IQ is a measure of your ability to problem solve , apply logic and to grasp and convey complex ideas. Emotional<br>
                 intelligence measures how well you are able to recognize emotion in yourself and others and then how well you use that <br>
                 awareness to make decisions.
                
              </p>
              <h4 class="header">Why is it important?</h4>
              <p>
                I think its important as it is something that you can apply to pretty much every relationship you have in your life. In work<br>
                 environments it allows you to understand your co-workers thoughts and decisions better as well as allow you to apply yourself<br>
                correctly in a group context leading to being a more productive colleague and worker in collaborative environments. In personal<br>
                relationships ie partner or friends a high Emotional intelligence allows you better to be able to understand them and help respond<br>
                to problems they are facing in their lives better aswell as allowing you to be able to convey your emotions to them in a more productive way.<br>
