      <ul>
      <li>Border:Acts as a sort of boundary that surrounds the element but also goes on the outside of the padding. When made visible it makes it easy to visualize<br>
      your different elements. </li> 
      <li>Margin: A margin is the space that surrounds an element and seperates them from eachother. </li> 
      <li>Padding:is the space between the element and the related content inside of it. This changes how elements within a container look and fit with eachother. 
      <br>When you increase the padding either the element has to grow bigger of the content inside has to shrink , by default the element increases in size. </li> 
      </ul>
