      The values I try to live by and what I also got affirmation for from friends and family is open mindedness
      I think this is largely due the the diverse environments I grew up in and the range of friends I have from 
      all walks of life. They are constantly teaching me new things and as I learn different things I'm able to apply 
      them to how I think and act in my day to day life. This is something that I always try to bring to unfamiliar 
      environments and always appreciate when other people reciprocate with a similar mindset.
      
      Another thing that I value a lot is respect and for me that means being respectful to everyone I interact with
      as in most scenarios its a lot easier than being disrespectful and will make the days of both you and who you
      interact with better. When someone else is being disrespectful rather than trying to return in kind I'd rather just
      try to remove myself from that situation. Also always treat strangers and workers at places you visit with respect 
      and kindness as you never know what somebody is going through and the world is hard enough
      for people without you treating them poorly or adding to the problems they face on that day.
      
      My final value to add here is humility as I know atleast for me the most brilliant,intelligent people in my life
      always act with humility and no matter how much personal success they face they never try and act superior over it.
      This to me also means never being afraid to be surrounded by smarter people and taking those sort of environments 
      as an awesome place to learn from.
